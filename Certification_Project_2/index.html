      <div class="about" id="tribute-info">
        <p>Diogo Jota, the Portugese phenom. A type of player to leave it all on the pitch and then some. A player with sometimes unparalelled finishing technique and that too in the most difficult league in the world. Showed up when you needed him most and never left you disappointed with his individual self. Gone and taken from us too soon, aged only 28. Only consolation is that he achieved most of his dreams before tragedy struck and won the premier league with Liverpool and also got to marry his highschool sweetheart just a week before he passed away. You will forever be missed Jota, football never forgets. <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj7-LYra-gg" target="_blank">Fly high sniper</a></p>

        <p>Diogo Jota has won a total of six major trophies in his career: one Premier League title, one FA Cup, two League Cups (EFL Cup), and two UEFA Nations League titles. He won the Premier League with Liverpool in the 2024-2025 season. He also won the FA Cup and two League Cups with Liverpool in the 2021-2022 season. With the Portugal national team, he won the UEFA Nations League in 2019 and 2025.</p>

    <div id="impact">
      <p>Diogo Jota was a game-changer at Liverpool—his arrival in 2020 immediately added clinical edge and incisiveness to their attack. Whether starting or coming off the bench, he had a knack for breaking deadlocks (like his record-breaking 22-second header vs Forest) and shifting momentum with smart positioning, cool finishing, and tireless pressing 
His 65 goals and 26 assists in just 182 appearances helped power Liverpool's charge to the 2024-25 Premier League title, and his ability to seamlessly slot into Slot's tactical system made him indispensable 
Off the pitch, he became beloved for his humble character, joyful demeanor, and strong bonds with teammates and fans—making his tragic loss in July 2025 a poignant moment for the club and its community .
